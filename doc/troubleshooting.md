## Data loss with PPK2

In some rare cases data loss can happen between the PPK2 firmware and the Power Profiler app.
If this happens, first please check your data by zooming in on the chart and look for gaps.
An occasional gap that lasts a few microseconds probably does not effect the accuracy of the data.
However if significant data loss is visible please check the following points:

- avoid using USB hubs
- if you can, try changing your USB connection from USB3 to USB2, or other way around
- update your USB drivers
- change the USB cable
