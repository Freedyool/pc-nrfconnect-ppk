# nRF Connect Power Profiler

Power Profiler app for [nRF Connect](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-core).

## Introduction

*nRF Connect Power Profiler* is a tool to communicate with the The Power Profiler Kit (PPK), an affordable and flexible tool to obtain real-time current measurements of your designs.
The PPK measures current consumption for a connected nRF5x Development Kit or any external board. It measures current from 1 Î¼A up to 70 mA and gives a detailed picture of the current profile for the user application.

All functionality is described in the [User Guide](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/ug_ppk/UG/ppk/PPK_user_guide_Intro.html).
